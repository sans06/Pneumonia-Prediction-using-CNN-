    Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Chest X-rays are currently the best method for diagnosing pneumonia.
    In general, a patient suffering from Pneumonia goes to the hospital to take an X-ray image waits for the doctor and then the doctor will check the X-ray then he decides whether the person has pneumonia or not.The process is time-consuming and if the patient has severe pneumonia  or not he has to wait several days to get the test results. The main objective of this project is to help the doctors to predict the pneumonia disease more accurately using a deep learning model. The objective is not only to help the doctors but also to the patients to verify whether they have pneumonia or not. By using this model we can precisely predict pneumonia.
